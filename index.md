## Uraik.us

Welcome to the personal website of Uraikus. I have a few projects I'm working on below:

[Uraikus IDE](https://ide.uraik.us) - An IDE that minifies and singlefies projects into a single .html file with a virtual file system. I use this on various networks that can be hard to acquire better software.

[Post Scrambler](https://scrambler.uraik.us) - This essentially makes memes that are designed to be hard to read by AI.
