# Personal Projects

[PatrickTrester.com](https://patricktrester.com) - My personal site where I review books that I'm reading. It's built on the Edge, where each page is compiled and stored in a Google Bucket. Each page is then cached all over the world for a fast response and Search Engine Optimization.

[Uraikus IDE](https://ide.uraik.us) - An IDE that minifies and singlefies projects into a single .html file with a virtual file system. I use this on various networks that can be hard to acquire better software.

[Bible](https://bible.uraik.us) - A Progressive Web App that contains various offline creeds, catechisms, confessions, Bible Translations (ESV Online, KJV, WEB, & ASV Offline), Offline Trinity Psalter (in-works), and a church information file containing bulletin, announcements, prayer requests, etc, (todo).

[Uraikus SSO](https://sso.uraik.us) - uraik.us anonymous Single Sign-On (SSO) is a secure, fast, and simple login tool that doesn't track its users. With bot-stopping mechanisms and pre-generated passcodes, its never been easier to make an account or to implement SSO. [Check out the API.](https://sso.uraik.us/api/)

[Uraikus Cloud Functions](https://www.uraik.us/end-points.html) **IN-WORK** A fast and easy to use cloud function system that integrates with the Uraikus IDE.

[Post Scrambler](https://scrambler.uraik.us) - This essentially makes memes that are designed to be hard to read by AI.

[Calender Printout](http://calendar.uraik.us) - This is just a simple program for generating a planner printout each month.

[Crelm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crelm) - The exceptionally small (3.9kb), super fast, independent, fully tested, and modular javascript library that simplifies and expedites page work flows.

[CrelmStat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crelmstat) - An expedient, minuscule (1kb), super simple, fully tested, zero dependency, generic state management tool. Made specifically (but not exclusively) for use with crelm.

[Crelm Popup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crelm-popup) - A small (<2kb), simple popup component with responsive design using the crelm library. Crelm is the only dependency.
